# Whatsapp-Chat-Analysis
As we are always indulged in chats on WhatsApp with our friends, family members or colleagues. Have you ever thought about who does how many messages in a year, month, day, a particular time period or who is the most active user? So keeping in mind I tried to build a WhatsApp Chat analyser.  

Python notebook link https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/nainish2/whatsapp-chat-analysis/blob/master/whatsapp_chat_analysis.ipynb
Each and every aspect is made understandable in this notebook.
The csv file which will form after processing the .txt file and the .txt file which is taken is provided above.
